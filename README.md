# A Codecademy-given React Project

List all your friends' information in one place, and schedule meetings with them. But because there's no backend here, be sure not to reload the page!

This project was given to me while working through Codecademy's "Full Stack Engineer" course. In-between lessons and quizzes, there are two types of project that a learner may be given: projects and "challenge" projects. The former lists some steps to complete; the latter lists some requirements to meet. This project was of the latter kind. 

Essentially, Codecademy used me like a very-high-level declarative programming language. "Make a JSX component that does the following." "Pass the following props to the following component and do some stuff with them." I obliged and completed the project in a day. This project is now on GitHub for the curious. 

You can also find a production version of it running at Evan-appointment-planner.surge.sh.

I also did a React Router project in the same day as I made this one, but that isn't on GitHub. I'll stick that one up too if anyone's interested.
